Multi-Paradigm Programming

GMIT Autumn/Winter Assignment
------------------------

////////
The Shop
////////

Introduction
The brief was to create a shop simulation demonstrating an understanding of both **Procedural** and **Object-Orientated** programming. The initial development of the programs was carried out in lectures with Dr. Dominic Carr after which we were requested to add additional functionality and bring the programs to completion. The Procedural approach was to be completed in both the `C` and `Python` programming languages while we had a choice for the object-orientated version between `Java` and `Python`.

#### Contents of repositry

The repositry contains the following:
- **shop.c** - the shop simulation in the C programming language
- **shop.py** - the shop simulation in the Python programming language (procedural approach)
- **shop_oop.py** - the shop simulation in the Python programming language (object-orientated approach)
- **customer.csv** - file for reading in customer name, budget, and shopping list
- **stock.csv** - file from which to read in shop float and shop stock
- **README.md** - this document
- **report.txt** - indepth report on the assignment and my findings
- **requirements.txt** - list of required python packages

#### Installation and running

The `C` program needs compiling before running. The following command will compile the file:
```
gcc -g shop.c -o out
```
To run the program we can then use the following:
```
./out
```
The `Python` files require a python environment and the appropriate packages imported. The easiest way to do this is with `Anaconda` which is available from here - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. Alternatively you can install the latest version of python manually and import the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
The programs can then be run from Terminal (or the command line) by simply typing `python` followed by the filename.

#### Credits

The bulk of the project came from lecture with Dr. Dominic Carr. Further online research provided solutions to individual problems and issues along the way. A list of specific online resources can be found at the end of the report.
