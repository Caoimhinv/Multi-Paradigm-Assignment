### introduction  
The brief was to create a shop simulation demonstrating an understanding of both **Procedural** and **Object-Orientated** programming. The initial development of the assignment was carried out in lectures with Dominic Carr and we were asked to add additional functionality. The procedural approach was to completed in both the **C** and **Python** programming languages while we had a choice for the object-orientated version between **Java** and **Python** again.

### contents of repositry
The repositry contains the following:
- **shop.c** - the shop simulation in the C programming language
- **shop.py** - the shop simulation in the Python programming language (procedural approach)
- **shop_oop.py** - the shop simulation in the Python programming language (object-orientated approach)
- **customer.csv** - file for reading in customer name, budget, and shopping list
- **stock.csv** - file from which to read in shop float and shop stock
- **README.md** - this document
- **report.txt** - indepth report on the assignment and my findings
- **requirements** - list of required python packages

### installation and running
The C program needs compiling before running. The following command will compile the file:
```
gcc -g shop.c -o out
```
To run the program then we use the following:
```
./out
```
The python files require a python environment to be created and the appropriate packages imported. The easiest way to do this is with Anaconda which is available from here - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. Alternatively you can install the latest version of python and import the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
The programs can then be run from Terminal (or the command line) by simply typing `python` followed by the filename.

### credits
The bulk of the project came from lecture with Dominic Carr. Further online research provided solutions to indivual problems and issues along the way. A list of specific online resources can be found at the end of the report.
